This repo is about analysing product reviews using Sentiment Analysis by using Flask and Streamlit.In my repo the streamlit file is the model loaded file and the flask file just gets input and passes to the streamlit page, where streamlit gets input from flask and model performs sentiment analysis then displays the output graph like gauge shaped(speedometer) graph output.I used ROBERTa base model for sentiment analysis.
